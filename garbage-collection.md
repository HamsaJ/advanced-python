# Garbage collection

In Python, garbage collection is the process of automatically freeing up memory that is no longer being used by the program. This is done by the Python interpreter's built-in garbage collector, which periodically checks for objects that are no longer in use and frees up the memory associated with them.

There are two main garbage collection algorithms used in Python: reference counting and cyclic garbage collection.

Reference counting is the simpler of the two algorithms and is used by default in CPython, the most widely used implementation of Python. In reference counting, each object has a counter that keeps track of the number of references to that object. When the counter reaches zero, the object is considered to be garbage and is freed up by the garbage collector.

Reference counting has a computational complexity of O(n), where n is the number of objects in the program. This means that as the number of objects grows, the time it takes for the garbage collector to run will also grow. Additionally, reference counting has the potential to cause memory leaks if there are circular references, where two or more objects refer to each other.

Cyclic garbage collection, also known as the generational garbage collector, is a more advanced algorithm that is designed to address the issues with reference counting. It uses a combination of reference counting and a cycle detection algorithm to detect and break circular references. The cyclic garbage collector is implemented in the Python interpreter's built-in gc module.

Cyclic garbage collection has a computational complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of objects and m is the number of cycles. This means that, as the number of cycles grows, the time it takes for the garbage collector to run will also grow.

In terms of cost, both reference counting and cyclic garbage collection have a cost associated with them. Reference counting has a constant cost for each object, while cyclic garbage collection has a variable cost that depends on the number of cycles.

In terms of efficiency, reference counting is generally considered to be more efficient than cyclic garbage collection. However, cyclic garbage collection is more effective at detecting and breaking circular references, which can cause memory leaks in reference counting.

Here is an example of how the garbage collector works in Python:

```python
import gc

def create_object():
    return [i for i in range(100000)]

# Create a new object
obj = create_object()

# Print the number of objects before garbage collection
print("Number of objects before GC:", len(gc.get_objects()))

# Run the garbage collector
gc.collect()

# Print the number of objects after garbage collection
print("Number of objects after GC:", len(gc.get_objects()))
```

In this example, the create\_object function creates a new object, which is a list of integers. The gc.get\_objects() function is used to get a list of all objects in the program, and the len function is used to get the number of objects. The gc.collect() function is used to run the garbage collector.

When the program is run, it will print the number of objects before and after the garbage collector is run. The number of objects will be reduced after the garbage collector is run, as it frees up memory that is no longer being used by the program.

It's worth noting that in most cases, Python's garbage collector runs automatically in the background and it's not necessary to call gc.collect() explicitly. However, it can be useful to call it in specific scenarios such as when memory is low and you want to reclaim it.
